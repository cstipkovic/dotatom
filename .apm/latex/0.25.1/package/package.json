The only current officially supported distribution is\n[TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/), but [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/) has\nbeen reported to work.\n\nYou need to ensure that the package can find your TeX distribution; if you're\nusing TeX Live and have installed to the default location then no further\naction should be required. To help the package find the distribution's\nbinaries, you need to configure the *TeX Path* configuration variable to point\nto the folder containing the binaries. This can be done either in the settings\nview, or directly in your `config.cson` file.\n\n## Usage\nInvoke the `build` command by pressing the default keybind `ctrl-alt-b` while in\na `.tex` file.\n\n## Status\nPlease note that this package is in a **beta** state. Right now everything is\nvery naÃ¯ve. As an example, there's no proper error and warning handling.\n\n## TODO\nCurrent wish list, in a semi-prioritized order.\n\n- [x] Progress indicator.\n- [ ] Build output.\n  - [x] Error handling.\n  - [ ] Warnings, and other non-critical messages.\n- [ ] BibTeX autocompletion support.\n- [x] Open PDF automatically.\n  - [x] Configurable.\n  - [x] Support for other distributions, besides OS X.\n  - [x] Support for custom PDF viewer.\n- [ ] Support for compilers other than latexmk.\n  - [x] Partially supported via the \"Builder\" concept, but no alternative\n    implementations have been created.\n  - [x] Support for texify compiler (MiKTeX).\n  - [ ] Add support for non-PDF typesetting (e.g. dvi).\n- [ ] Project management.\n  - [ ] Setting to override the output directory.\n  - [ ] Setting to override the builder.\n\nIf you see something that's missing, or disagree with the prioritization,\nconsider submitting a [feature request](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/issues?labels=feature&state=open),\nand if you're feeling super helpful, submit a pull request with an updated\nTODO list :sparkling_heart:\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex","_id":"latex@0.25.1","_shasum":"f47893cd72d1c5b4086a1bfd806867302eedd2d2","_resolved":"file:../d-115726-27833-18uhcpm/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115726-27833-18uhcpm/package.tgz"}
