  "readme": "# Jasmine for Atom\n\n> Easily write Jasmine tests for your project in Atom.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\n$ apm install atom-jasmine\n```\n\nOr Settings ➔ Packages ➔ Search for `jasmine`\n\n## Release Notes\n\n### 0.8.0\n\n* Added [more snippets for Matchers](https://github.com/zacharytamas/atom-jasmine/commit/b275251fbfec94b1d3ae3a9131a2e8e25b56143e). Thanks [storor](https://github.com/storor)!\n* Added extra (optional) breakpoints to some snippets to help with flow while stubbing out large amounts of tests at once. Thanks [stramel](http://github.com/stramel)!\n\n\n### 0.7.0\n\n* Added `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file to give credit where credit is due.\n* Add Typescript grammar (thanks [pringshia](http://github.com/pringshia))\n* Add project-dependent indentation (thanks [stramel](http://github.com/stramel))\n\n### 0.6.0\n\n* Added more Expectation snippets via a pull request from [aki77](http://github.com/aki77). Thanks!\n\n### 0.3.0\n\n* Adding more Expectation snippets. Modeling these after Pivotal's\n  original plugin for TextMate. A very popular port to SublimeText\n  has several thousand installs so these snippets and shortcuts are\n  likely very well known. For those switching to Atom from either\n  editor they should be ready to go out of the box.\n\n### 0.1.0 - Initial release\n\n*Note*: For initial release I've only added a couple quick snippets but have several things in mind that I'll be adding over time.\n\n## License\n\nMIT © [Zachary Jones](http://github.com/zacharytamas)\n",
