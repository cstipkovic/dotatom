Note there's an additional limitation compared to the normal build: you cannot use any globals in expressions (e.g. `Date`, `parseInt` etc.).\n\n---\n\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://vuejs.org\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"100\"src=\"http://vuejs.org/images/logo.png\"></a></p>\n\n# Vue.js [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/yyx990803/vue/master.svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/yyx990803/vue) [![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/yyx990803/vue/master.svg)](https://codecov.io/github/yyx990803/vue?branch=master) [![Selenium Test Status](https://saucelabs.com/buildstatus/vuejs)](https://saucelabs.com/u/vuejs)\n\n## Intro\n\nVue.js is a library for building interactive web interfaces. It provides data-reactive components with a simple and flexible API. Core features include:\n\n- Two-way data binding\n- Plain JavaScript objects as reactive models\n- Component-oriented development style\n\nNote that Vue.js only supports [ES5-compliant browsers](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/) (IE8 and below are not supported).
